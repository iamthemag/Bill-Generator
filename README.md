# Bill Generator

## Overview

The Bill Generator is a robust and user-friendly tool designed to automate the billing process for restaurants and similar establishments. This script simplifies bill creation by integrating menu items, prices, and real-time user inputs into a comprehensive and professionally formatted bill. It leverages the power of Bash scripting to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and ease of use.

## Why Itâ€™s the Best

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The tool prompts users for essential information, including restaurant name, menu items, and prices, ensuring a seamless and intuitive setup.
- **Customizable**: Users can easily add or modify menu items and prices, allowing the tool to adapt to different business needs and offerings.
- **Automatic File Generation**: Upon completing the order, the script automatically generates a detailed bill in both text and PDF formats. This ensures that you have a digital and printable record of every transaction.
- **Print Integration**: The bill can be sent directly to a selected printer, streamlining the process from bill generation to customer handover.
- **Backup and Update Mechanism**: The script creates a new file with the current date and restaurant name each time it runs, ensuring that you always have a fresh and up-to-date billing file without overwriting previous data.

## How It Works

1. **Input Data**: Enter the restaurant name, menu items, and prices.
2. **Order Processing**: Take customer orders and calculate totals.
3. **Generate Bill**: Create a detailed bill in text and PDF formats.
4. **Print Option**: Send the bill to a printer of your choice.
